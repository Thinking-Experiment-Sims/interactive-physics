# Physics Simulations Showcase

A clean, modern showcase for interactive physics simulations. Built with vanilla HTML/CSS using The Thinking Experiment brand colors.

## Features

- Dark background (#0d1117) with gold accents (#FFB700)
- Responsive grid layout
- Links to live simulations and source code
- Mobile-friendly design

## Simulations

1. **Tangent Line Analysis** - Kinematics simulation for analyzing instantaneous velocity
2. **Electrostatics: Conduction & Induction** - Visualize electron flow during charging
3. **Ripple Lab Studio** - Explore wave interference patterns

## Local Development

Simply open `index.html` in a web browser. No build process required.

## Deployment

This site is designed for GitHub Pages deployment:

1. Create a new repository in the `thinking-experiment-sim` organization
2. Push these files to the repository
3. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings (deploy from main branch)

## License

All simulations are open source and free to use for educational purposes.
